# 🍽 Swiggy Dummy Dataset - SQL Project

**This project is a simulated case study of Swiggy, a popular Indian food delivery platform. It uses a dummy dataset created to resemble real-world delivery operations, allowing hands-on SQL practice for data analysis and business intelligence.**

# 📌 Objective
**To explore and analyze food delivery data using intermediate-level SQL queries. The goal is to simulate data-driven decision-making in a food delivery context, applying concepts like aggregation, filtering, subqueries, conditional logic, and reporting.**

# 🧾Dataset Description
**The Swiggy Dummy Dataset is a simulated representation of real-world food delivery data. It contains essential information about customer orders, restaurants, delivery partners, and delivery performance. This dataset is structured to support SQL-based analytical queries and business decision-making scenarios.**
