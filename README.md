#🍽 Swiggy Dummy Dataset - SQL Project

**This project is a simulated case study of Swiggy, a popular Indian food delivery platform. It uses a dummy dataset created to resemble real-world delivery operations, allowing hands-on SQL practice for data analysis and business intelligence.**

📌 #Objective
**To explore and analyze food delivery data using intermediate-level SQL queries. The goal is to simulate data-driven decision-making in a food delivery context, applying concepts like aggregation, filtering, subqueries, conditional logic, and reporting.**
