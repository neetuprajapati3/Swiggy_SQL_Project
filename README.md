# 🍽 Swiggy Dummy Dataset - SQL Project

**This project is a simulated case study of Swiggy, a popular Indian food delivery platform. It uses a dummy dataset created to resemble real-world delivery operations, allowing hands-on SQL practice for data analysis and business intelligence.**

# 📌 Objective
**To explore and analyze food delivery data using intermediate-level SQL queries. The goal is to simulate data-driven decision-making in a food delivery context, applying concepts like aggregation, filtering, subqueries, conditional logic, and reporting.**

# 🧾Dataset Description
**The Swiggy Dummy Dataset is a simulated representation of real-world food delivery data. It contains essential information about customer orders, restaurants, delivery partners, and delivery performance. This dataset is structured to support SQL-based analytical queries and business decision-making scenarios.**

# 📌 Column Descriptions:
* Order_ID: A unique identifier assigned to each order.
* City: The name of the city where the customer placed the order.
* Restaurant: The name of the restaurant from which the food was ordered.
* Dish: The specific food item ordered by the customer.
* Customer_ID: A unique identifier for the customer who placed the order.
* Order_Date: The date on which the order was placed.
* Delivery_Partner_ID: A unique identifier for the delivery person assigned to deliver the order.
* Delivery_Time_Minutes: The total time (in minutes) taken to deliver the order.
* Order_Amount: The total amount charged for the order, in decimal format (e.g., 249.50).
* Customer_Rating: The rating (out of 5) given by the customer after delivery.
* Order_Status: The current status of the order (e.g., Delivered, Cancelled, Failed).
* Is_On_Time: A boolean value indicating whether the delivery was on time (TRUE) or late (FALSE).

# ✅ Conclusion
**This project provided a hands-on opportunity to work with a simulated Swiggy food delivery dataset using intermediate-level SQL queries. Through various analytical questions, we explored customer behavior, delivery performance, restaurant efficiency, and order trends. It allowed for practical application of SQL concepts such as filtering, aggregation, grouping, subqueries, and conditional logic.**
